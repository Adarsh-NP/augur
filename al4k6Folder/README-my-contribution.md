I contributed equally. I wrote the issues page and deployed the project to my server. I was not involved with planning, but I implemented every task during sprints, creating the same number of graphs as my other members that correlated to the repos that had any issues. I was also helpful at times with troubleshooting and debugging. In the end, I alone deployed the project to my EC2 instance and troubleshooted those issues by myself, but that was also because I had the technical knowledge in that area and I had done it a bit last minute.S
