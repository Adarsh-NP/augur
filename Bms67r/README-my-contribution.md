## My Contributions

 I led the group in terms of pointing out due dates, encouraging my other group mates to work, assigning roles, etc. I wrote most of the code, cleaned up most of the documentation, and presented for the longest time by myself. The code was created using the Angular framework, I created the UI design and researched/created the graphical representations of the Augur data that we included. I also wrote a fair share of the documentation for each of the sprints. On the design documents, I wrote the initial description of our front end project and made the use case diagrams.
   
We selected using the Angular framework early on, before sprint one, and since I was the only one who then knew how to use it, I asked if learning the framework for later sprints would be a problem. I was told that it wouldn't be, but when it came time for them to add something to the actual project, most did not even try to learn it and those who did gave up after trying the basics (I had to learn from scratch when I learned it the first time, and it is not that hard to pick up the basics). So I wrote everything that is included in the final submission. It isn't very extensive in terms of graphical representations, but I could not do the amount 4 people could do myself.
