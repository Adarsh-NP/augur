## My Specific Contribution
In our brainstorming process I helped think of ideas focused on contributing to Augur's purpose of analyzing repos community health and activity. Looking through the database tables and the already existing APIs, I thought there would be an advantage in looking in the level of communication on issues in repos. In our design document, I added the details of why we chose that endpoint and how it would contribute to augur. I recieved assistance from my group members to get my augur to run on my server and using pgadmin, Ali and I developed the SQL for the issue messages over time endpoint. I edited the issue.py document to add the function as well as a test function in test_issue_functions.py. The routes.py were edited in both routes.py and the test_issue_routes.py. My main contributions were in the issue metric folder. We troubleshooted issues together and hepled them spot issues in the functions they created, the few there were. I showed up everyday to work with my group and contributed where I could.
