# Specific Contributions

Out group was an API and front-end team. As the only group member having chosen API, I was left fully in charge of this aspect, with the other members working together on the front-end.

I created three endpoints (committers-locations, issue-locations, pull-request-locations). I created a new table with dummy data, and Katie helped me manually enter random latitudes, longitudes, city, and states. I also wrote the python test files for the endpoints. I wrote the documentation for the project.
