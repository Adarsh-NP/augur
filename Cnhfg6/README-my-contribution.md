- I built most of the frontend web app, which includes:
	- generating an Angular project
	- setting up the components for each page
	- designing the layout and functionality of the navbar
	- working out the routing between pages
	- writing functions in the data service to make API calls
	- dynamically displaying retrieved data in charts or boxes on each page
