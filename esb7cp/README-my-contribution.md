My specific contributions:

For my group I did the contributers page. This includes the javascript to make it work and the graphs to show up. Additionally, I did work on the
drop down menus (on all pages) so that they would dynamically update with the correct repositories. Finally, I also gave the base outline for the 
html of our pages.
