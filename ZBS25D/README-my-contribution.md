## My Contributions

### Sprint 1
#### For sprint 1, my contributions were adding to our goals for this project. Our group, including me, all came up with a few endpoints we may want to use in the final application. I also helped create use cases for our design document. I created one myself, and I helped my group with another. The design document was a lot of contributions from the entire group. We all worked together to complete everything.

### Sprint 2
#### For sprint 2, Jeremy and I worked together on deployment. We worked together to deploy the basic application we had onto a Ruby on Rails backend server. We ran into a few issues which required some googling, but we were able to figure it out.

### Sprint 3
#### For sprint 3, I worked on a basic design using javascript along with chart.js. My design was focused on graphics and visualization and chart.js works really well to complete this task. My design was design 2 in our sprint 3 README. It just used Ajax requests to call 3 API endpoints and then used chart.js and other javascript to create graphics that displayed the data from those endpoints.

### Sprint 4
#### For sprint 4, We chose to stick with our angular application. I helped with finding a good way to visulaize the data from the endpoints. Turns out, that chart.js worked really well in angular as well, so I recommended that to my group and we were able to utilize it for a graph representation of data. I also helped with an info page. I made a description that explains how our application works, how to use our application, and what our application does.
