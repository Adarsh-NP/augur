Our team was a mix of Back-end and Front-end functionality.  In our project, I mainly helped Joseph with the data endpoints and then I myself connected those data endponts to variables on the front-end in order to display some type of data.  A big one that I did was using a Google Maps map to drop pins based on the locations (latitude and longitude) of the contributors.  Once we were able to get a database that would display this type of data in JSON format, I was in charge of parsing through he data and dropping pins based on these locations.  I was also in charge of displaying the number of Contributors, Issuers, and Pull Requests for each Repo Group.  With this function, I would parse through each type of data with a counter that adds 1 everytime it goes through the loop. The only thing I wish I did differently with this function is creating a bar graph with these 3 sections and 2 groups to give a better visualization of the data.
