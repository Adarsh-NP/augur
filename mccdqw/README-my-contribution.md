My contribution for this project was the testing coverage metric. The goal of this metric is to show how much a particular repository has been tested. Using subroutines and statements from the program, the percentages of each are calculated. We then wanted to display this information to the user. We had to manually input our own data because when we made the API call, there was no data to be accessed.
