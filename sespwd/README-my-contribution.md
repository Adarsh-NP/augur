2. Wrote function and route tests for the committer-affiliation metric.
3. Created the contributor-data metric and endpoint which returns a gender and ethnicity prediction and probability for each contributor to a metric using the NamSor API.
4. Wrote function and route tests for the contributor-data metric.
5. Wrote the contributorData.js file which dynamically formats the charts on the Group 1 and Group 2 pages with data from the contributor-data and testing-coverage APIs.

7. Configured and deployed our group's updated augur version on my server.
8. Wrote the server.py script used to deploy our front end and hosted it on my server.
