README for final
In the end, we were a frontend focused group that created a new front end.   I worked on all the documentation (READme's, tutorials and testings/how-to's) made a few front end changes to one page (composing the About page with links to documentation, tutorials, and abouts) and attempted to help solve a logic problem with a piece of the code (solution ended up not being used in the end, however, because a better method was found).
