My Contributions To The Final Project Group

In this final project, we built a plan in sprint1, this plan assigns three of us to implement the following function
(1),individual Repo Stats 
(2) repo-group stats
(3) repo-group overview
	
Which what I did is (3)

For more detail about my part,the main idea is to construct a web page which allow user to choose a repo-group from dropdown
list with repo group name, after the single click the bottom half of page will display the information about this selected group
like group ID,description, etc.

By doing this, I extract the api using js and html tool, after the function test I added css to make the whole page looks more fluent.
