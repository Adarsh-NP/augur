I designed the overall user experience of the site. My original plans of having repo groups like MHS, Zephyr, etc. fell through the cracks when the group realized we didn't have access to that data. I had to ditch all the work I did specific to having those repo groups.  

Samantha's idea was originally just to use the gender prediction but I opened up the idea to doing ethnicity prediction as well. Again, See the ethnicity prediction for "Sean Goggins" in Group 11. It might not be accurate but it's a new metric of how diverse each repo group is that relates to the health of the group rather than just the health of the project.  

My role was deciding where things went on the pages. The intended layout was to also have information about the repo groups. Sweta and I decided how we wanted data to be visualized. Samantha helped with the auto population of tables of the repo group pages which I then used on the home page.  

I also decided what information the APIs would return when calling them to be displayed somehow on the site. Anything with numbers was diplayed in a chart, any contributor or committer information was displayed in a table. Finding out how to pin more than one location took the most time but I eventually figured it out on the last sprint. I feel like it's a pretty cool feature.
