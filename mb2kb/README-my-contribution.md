# Personal Contributions to the project
- walked every one of my group members through getting a working copy of augur running
- read through all the working groups and chose the endpoints we would create based on what was valuable and doable
- wrote most of the design document and helped others with their contributions to it
- wrote two of our three SQL queries (kyle helped with the second one) and made sure they had a readable structure similar to existing code 
- helped Andrew and Ali follow the existing query structure
