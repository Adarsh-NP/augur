## My Contribution

- Back End
setup the firebase, connected firebase to Angular. Then I deployed the project to the firebase server.

- Front End
I implemented the front-end of the pull-request page, top-commiter page, and repository-issue page.

- Combine Work
I put the javascript file for API calls, front-end code and backend code together.

- Fix bug
I fixed several bugs. Since javascript can not be directly used in Angular, I modified it to make it work. I also helped fixing bugs with API calls.
