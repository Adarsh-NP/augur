My contributions to this project were the files commits.js commits.html and the dropdowns that populated from the apis that
were in common.js.
I also found the chartJS jquery file and managed to read in the apis to display our data.
Armaja evan and I all were working on the api read in to chart.js, and they helped me to make mine work so we could implement it across our project
