## My Contributions to the Semester Project

# I contributed to the final project in three main ways

  1. I contributed ideas about what endpoints to create during the initial brainstorming sessions.
  2. I assisted in determining where in the database schema the necessary information for the endpoints would be found and helped debug SQL commands.
  3. I wrote tests for all three endpoints based on the existing Augur testing model.
