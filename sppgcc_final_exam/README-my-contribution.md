#### My Contribution
1. **Designed the Front end.** 
2. **Gave the ideas of showing visualizations.** 
3. **Called the API endpoints to populate data.** 
4. **Made all the html files import into least files since we are not using any front-end framework.** 
5. **Description:**
* Specifically used the **NamSor API** that took the contributor's first and lastname to return their gender and ethnicity. 
* These data were shown in a table and the percentage of contributorsÂ from each gender and ethnicity were shown using google pie charts.
* Called the **Testing coverage API** to show the testing coverage as a percentage using a line meter-gauge.
* The percentage of subroutines and percentage of statements covered were shown in two different line-meter-gauge.
