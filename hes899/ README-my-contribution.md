#My Contributions

I have mentioned this in the online quiz format as well, but I did not have any
experience at all with Angular (which is what we were using to implement our project)
so I mainly focused on the side tasks for this project and tried to provide input when 
possible. 

I was responsible for a 2 separate designs of our webpage in the early stages of this
project, which we ended up keeping in our repository but never really used. I then 
created documentation for what our main design would do and how it would function. 
I also created a mock website design as just a simple visualization of what we could
do, although we kind of already had a main design that we knew would look the cleanest
and perform the best. I also created documentation for that design as well. Like I said
earlier, I did not have any experience with Angular so I was not as much of a help in the
main design as I would've preferred.
