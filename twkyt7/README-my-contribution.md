## Tim Kuehner

My specific contributions can be summarized throughout the project as
* Helped organize thoughts of my group members and submitted my own ideas to the 3 endpoints that we would create in the AUGUR system
* Assisted with deploying AUGUR on our systems so that we could create, run, and test the API endpoints we would later create.  
* Helped with brainstorming and grinding out the route files for the API endpoints
* Helped with testing and troubleshooting the endpoints on the server
* Demonstrated the work we did during the presentation section at the end of the semester
