# Sprint 3

## Goals
1. Cleaning up the fronted
    - There were a few issues on Augur's repo that seem to be resolved mostly, but I've been spending the most time learning Vue and reading Augur's frontend code
    - I plan to make the card components cleaner by
        - Improving responsive layout
        - Making all child elements readable
        - Doing the same, but for the Graphs
    - I familiarized myself with using Vue by building a small [To-Do list app](https://github.com/averywald/vueTodo)
2. Consolidating the API request process: [Issue #397](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/397)
    - I've been spending some time trying to digest the TypeScript Augur API code, but haven't been able to make much sense of it, so solving that issue(s) is on my backburner currently

## What's Next
- Impelementing frontend UI tweaks
- Testing and debugging API code
- Deploying changes to my server once more progress has been made
